# 2.9.5 Cleaning up a Context-Free Grammar

Normally, grammars supplied by people do not contain undefined, unreachable or non-productive non-terminals. If they do, it is almost certainly a mistake (or a test!), and we would like to detect and report them. Such anomalies can, however, occur normally in generated grammars or be introduced by some grammar transformations, in which case we wish to detect them to “clean up” the grammar. Cleaning the grammar is also very important when we obtain the result of parsing as a parse-forest grammar (Section 3.7.4, Chapter 13, and many other places).

The algorithm to detect and remove useless non-terminals and rules from a context-free grammar consists of two steps: remove the non-productive rules and remove the unreachable non-terminals. Surprisingly it is not necessary to remove the useless rules due to undefined non-terminals: the first step does this for us automatically.

We will use the grammar of Figure 2.27 for our demonstration. It looks fairly innocent: all its non-terminals are defined and it does not exhibit any suspicious constructions.

### 2.9.5.1 Removing Non-Productive Rules

We find the non-productive rules by finding the productive ones. Our algorithm hinges on the observation that a rule is productive if its right-hand side consists of symbols all of which are productive. Terminal symbols are productive since they produce terminals and empty is productive since it produces the empty string. A non-terminal is productive if there is a productive rule for it, but the problem is that initially we do not know which rules are productive, since that is exactly the thing we are trying to find out.

We solve this dilemma by first marking all rules and non-terminals as “Don’t know”. We now go through the grammar of Figure 2.27 and for each rule for which we do know that all its right-hand side members are productive, we mark the rule and the non-terminal it defines as “Productive”. This yields markings for the rules A--->a, C--->c, and E--->e, and for the non-terminals A, C and E.

Now we know more and apply this knowledge in a second round through the grammar. This allows us to mark the rule B--->bC and the non-terminal B, since now C is known to be productive. A third round gives us S--->AB and S. A fourth round yields nothing new, so there is no point in a fifth round.

We now know that S, A, B, C, and E are productive, but D and F and the rule S--->DE are still marked “Don’t know”. However, now we know more: we know that we have pursued all possible avenues for productivity, and have not found any possibilities for D, F and the second rule for S. That means that we can now upgrade our knowledge “Don’t know” to “Non-productive”. The rules for D, F and the second rule for S can be removed from the grammar; the result is shown in Figure 2.28. This makes D and F undefined, but S stays in the grammar since it is productive, in spite of having a non-productive rule.

It is interesting to see what happens when the grammar contains an undefined non-terminal, say U. U will first be marked “Don’t know”, and since there is no rule defining it, it will stay “Don’t know”. As a result, any rule R featuring U in its right-hand side will also stay “Don’t know”. Eventually both will be recognized as “Non-productive”, and all rules R will be removed. We see that an “undefined non-terminal” is just a special case of a “non-productive” non-terminal: it is nonproductive because there is no rule for it.

The above knowledge-improving algorithm is our first example of a closure algorithm. Closure algorithms are characterized by two components: an initialization, which is an assessment of what we know initially, partly derived from the situation and partly “Don’t know”; and an inference rule, which is a rule telling how knowledge from several places is to be combined. The inference rule for our problem was:

For each rule for which we do know that all its right-hand side members are productive, mark the rule and the non-terminal it defines as “Productive’.’

It is implicit in a closure algorithm that the inference rule(s) are repeated until nothing changes any more. Then the preliminary “Don’t know” can be changed into a more definitive “Not X”, where “X” was the property the algorithm was designed to detect.

Since it is known beforehand that in the end all remaining “Don’t know” indications are going to be changed into “Not X”, many descriptions and implementations of closure algorithms skip the whole “Don’t know” stage and initialize everything to “Not X”. In an implementation this does not make much difference, since the meaning of the bits in computer memory is not in the computer but in the mind of the programmer, but especially in text-book descriptions this practice is unelegant and can be confusing, since it just is not true that initially all the non-terminals in our grammar are “Non-productive”.

We will see many examples of closure algorithms in this book; they are discussed in more detail in Section 3.9.

### 2.9.5.2 Removing Unreachable Non-Terminals

A non-terminal is called reachable or accessible if there exists at least one sentential form, derivable from the start symbol, in which it occurs. So a non-terminal A is reachable if S→* αAβ for some α and β.

We found the non-productive rules and non-terminals by finding the “productive” ones. Likewise, we find the unreachable non-terminals by finding the reachable ones. For this, we can use the following closure algorithm. First, the start symbol is marked “reachable”; this is the initialization. Then, for each rule in the grammar of the form A→α with A marked, all non-terminals in α are marked; this is the inference rule. We continue applying the inference rule until nothing changes any more. Now the unmarked non-terminals are not reachable and their rules can be removed.

The first round marks A and B; the second marks C, and the third produces no change. The result — a clean grammar — is in Figure 2.29. We see that rule E--->e, which was reachable and productive in Figure 2.27 became isolated by removing the non-productive rules, and is then removed by the second step of the cleaning algorithm.

Removing the unreachable rules cannot cause a non-terminal N used in a reachable rule to become undefined, since N can only become undefined by removing all its defining rules but since N is reachable, the above process will not remove any rule for it. A slight modification of the same argument shows that removing the unreachable rules cannot cause a non-terminal N used in a reachable rule to become non-productive: N, which was productive or it would not have survived the previous clean-up step, can only become non-productive by removing some of its defining rules but since N is reachable, the above process will not remove any rule for it. This shows conclusively that after removing non-productive non-terminals and then removing unreachable non-terminals we do not need to run the step for removing non-productive non-terminals again.

It is interesting to note, however, that first removing unreachable non-terminals and then removing non-productive rules may produce a grammar which again contains unreachable non-terminals. The grammar of Figure 2.27 is an example in point.

Furthermore it should be noted that cleaning a grammar may remove all rules, including those for the start symbol, in which case the grammar describes the empty language; see Section 2.6.

Removing the non-productive rules is a bottom-up process: only the bottom level, where the terminal symbols live, can know what is productive. Removing unreachable non-terminals is a top-down process: only the top level, where the start symbol(s) live(s), can know what is reachable.
