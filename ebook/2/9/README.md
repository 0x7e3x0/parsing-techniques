# 2.9 Hygiene in Context-Free Grammars

All types of grammars can contain useless rules, rules that cannot play a role in any successful production process. A production process is successful when it results in a terminal string. Production attempts can be unsuccessful by getting stuck (no further substitution possible) or by entering a situation in which no substitution sequence will ever remove all non-terminals. An example of a Type 0 grammar that can get stuck is

When we start with the first rule for S, all goes well and we produce the terminal string x. But when we start with rule 2 for S we get stuck, and when we start with rule 3, we get ourselves in an infinite loop, producing more and more Cs. Rules 2, 3 and 5 can never occur in a successful production process: they are useless rules, and can be removed from the grammar without affecting the language produced.

Useless rules are not a fundamental problem: they do not obstruct the normal production process. Still, they are dead wood in the grammar, and one would like to remove them. Also, when they occur in a grammar specified by a programmer, they probably point at some error, and one would like to detect them and give warning or error messages.

The problems with the above grammar were easy to understand, but it can be shown that in general it is undecidable whether a rule in a Type 0 or 1 grammar is useless: there cannot be an algorithm that does it correctly in all cases. For contextfree grammars the situation is different, however, and the problem is rather easily solved.

Rules in a context-free grammar can be useless through three causes: they may contain undefined non-terminals, they may not be reachable from the start symbol, and they may fail to produce anything. We will now discuss each of these ailments in more detail; an algorithm to rid a grammar of them is given in Section 2.9.5.
