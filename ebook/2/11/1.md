# 2.11.1 Attribute Grammars

The semantic clauses in an attribute grammar assume that each node in the production tree has room for one or more attributes, which are just values (numbers, strings or anything else) sitting in nodes in production trees. For simplicity we restrict our-
selves to attribute grammars with only one attribute per node. The semantic clause of a rule in such a grammar contains some formulas which compute the attributes of some of the non-terminals in that rule (represented by nodes in the production tree) from those of other non-terminals in that same rule. These semantic actions connect only attributes that are local to the rule: the overall semantics is composed as the
result of all the local computations.

If the semantic action of a rule R computes the attribute of the left-hand side of R, that attribute is derived. If it computes an attribute of one of the non-terminals in the right-hand side of R,say A, then that attribute is inherited by A. Derived attributes
are also called “synthesized attributes”. The attribute grammar for our example is:

The semantic clauses are given between curly brackets. A0 is the (derived) attribute of the left-hand side; A1, ..., An are the attributes of the members of the right-hand side. Traditionally, terminal symbols in a right-hand side are also counted in determining the index of A, although they do not (normally) carry attributes; the Digit in rule 2 is in position 3 and its attribute is A3. Most systems for handling attribute grammars
have less repetitive ways to express rule 3a through 3j.

The initial production tree for 3+5+1 is given in Figure 2.31. First only the attributes for the leaves are known, but as soon as all attributes in a right-hand side of a production rule are known, we can use its semantic clause to compute the attribute of its left-hand side. This way the attribute values (semantics) percolate up the tree, finally reach the start symbol and provide us with the semantics of the whole sentence, as shown in Figure 2.32. Attribute grammars are a very powerful method of handling the semantics of a language. They are discussed in more detail in Section
15.3.1.
