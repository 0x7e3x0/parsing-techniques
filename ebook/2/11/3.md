# 2.11.3 Augmented Transition Networks

Semantics can be introduced in a recursive transition network (Section 2.8) by attaching actions to the transitions in the graphs. These actions can set variables, construct data structures, etc. A thus augmented recursive transition network is known as an
Augmented Transition Network (or ATN) (Woods [378]).
