# 2.11.2 Transduction Grammars

Transduction grammars define the semantics of a string (the “input string”) as another string, the “output string” or “translation”, rather than as the final attribute of

the start symbol. This method is less powerful but much simpler than using attributes and often sufficient. The semantic clause in a production rule is just the string that should be output for the corresponding node. We assume that the string for a node is output just after the strings for all its children. Other variants are possible and in fact usual. We can now write a transduction grammar which translates a sum of digits
into instructions to compute the value of the sum.

This transduction grammar translates 3+5+1 into:

which is indeed what 3+5+1 “means”.
