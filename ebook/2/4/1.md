# 2.4.1 短语结构案例

直到现在，我们用语法只生成了一个句子，一个特定的时尚，不过语法的目的是生成所有句子。幸运的是还有系统可以做到这个。我们用a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup>c<sup>n</sup>语法来做例子。我们从起始符号开始，然后用系统尝试所有可能的替换来生成所有的句子形式；我们只需要等着看哪些句子在什么时候演变成句子。手动完成10个句子试试。如果我们不小心，很容易就会生成像**aSQ, aaSQQ, aaaSQQQ**,...这样的形式，而且我们将永远也看不到一个完整的句子。原因是我们太过专注于一个单一的句子形式：我们应该给所有的句子同样的时间。这可以通过下面的算法完成，其保持句子形式的一个队列（也就是一个列表，表中是我们要加到结尾和从开头删除的元素）。

从起始符号开始，作为队列中唯一的句子形式。现在继续以下操作：

- 考虑队列中的第一个句子形式。
- 从左到右扫描它，寻找符合左侧生成规则的字符串。
- 发现的每一个这样的字符串，复制足够的句子形式，替换每一个符合左侧生成规则的字符串，通过规则中不同的选项，然后把它们全部添加到队列末尾。
- 如果原始句子形式不包含任何非终结符，把它作为语言中的一个句子写下来。
- 扔掉原始的句子形式；它已经被处理完成了。

如果没有匹配的规则，并且句子形式不是一个完成的句子，那这就是一条死胡同；它们会被上述过程自动删除，不留任何痕迹。

因为上述过程枚举了PS语言中所有的字符串，PS语言也被称为递归可枚举集，这里的“递归”是指“通过一个可行的递归算法”。

图Fig 2.7中a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup>c<sup>n</sup>语言的处理过程的开始几步，展示在图Fig 2.17中。队列向右运行，其第一项在左侧：

可以看到，并不是每次我们打开曲柄都可以得到一个句子；实际上，在这种情况下真正的句子十分稀少。当然是因为在这一过程中，发展出了很多的侧边线，而这都需要同等的重视。不过我们可以肯定，每一个可以生成的句子最终都会生成：我们不会放过任何可能。这种方式被称为*广度优先生成*；而计算机做的比人要好。

It is tempting to think that it is unnecessary to replace all left-hand sides that we found in the top-most sentential form. Why not just replace the first one and wait for the resulting sentential form to come up again and then do the next one? This is wrong, however, since doing the first one may ruin the context for doing the second one. A simple example is the grammar

![图2](../../img/2.4.1_2.png)

First doing A--->b will lead to a blind alley and the grammar will produce nothing. Doing both possible substitutions will lead to the same blind alley, but then there will also be a second sentential form, ac. This is also an example of a grammar for which the queue will get empty after a (short) while.

If the grammar is context-free (or regular) there is no context to ruin and it is quite safe to just replace the first (or only) match.

There are two remarks to be made here. First, it is not at all certain that we will indeed obtain a sentence for all our effort: it is quite possible that every new sentential form again contains non-terminals.We should like to know this in advance by examining the grammar, but it can be proven that it is impossible to do so for PS grammars. The formal-linguist says “It is undecidable whether a PS grammar produces the empty set”, which means that there cannot be an algorithm that will for every PS grammar correctly tell if the grammar produces at least one sentence. This does not mean that we cannot prove for some given grammar that it generates nothing, if that is the case. It means that the proof method used will not work for all grammars: we could have a program that correctly says Yes in finite time if the answer is Yes but that takes infinite time if the answer is No. In fact, our generating procedure above is such an algorithm that gives the correct Yes/No answer in infinite time (although we can have an algorithm that gives a Yes/Don’t know answer in finite time). Although it is true that because of some deep property of formal languages we cannot always get exactly the answer we want, this does not prevent us from obtaining all kinds of useful information that gets close. We shall see that this is a recurring phenomenon. The computer scientist is aware of but not daunted by the impossibilities from formal linguistics.

The second remark is that when we do get sentences from the above production process, they may be produced in an unexploitable order. For non-monotonic grammars the sentential forms may grow for a while and then suddenly shrink again, perhaps even to the empty string. Formal linguistics proves that there cannot be an algorithm that for all PS grammars produces their sentences in increasing (actually “non-decreasing”) length. In other words, the parsing problem for PS grammars is unsolvable. (Although the terms are used interchangeably, it seems reasonable to use “undecidable” for yes/no questions and “unsolvable” for problems.)
