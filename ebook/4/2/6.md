# 4.2.6 Undoing the Effect of the CNF Transformation

When we examine the grammar of Figure 4.6 and the recognition table of Figure 4.16, we see that the recognition table contains the information we need on most of the non-terminals of the original grammar. However, there are a few nonterminals missing in the recognition table: Scale, Real, and Empty. Scale and Empty were removed because they became unreachable, after the elimination of ε-rules. Empty was removed altogether, because it only derived the empty string, and Scale was replaced by Scale’, where Scale’ derives exactly the same as Scale, except for the empty string. We can use this to add some more information to the recognition table: at every occurrence of Scale’, we add Scale.

The non-terminal Real was removed because it became unreachable after eliminating the unit rules. Now, the CYK algorithm does not require that all non-terminals in the grammar be reachable. We could just as well have left the non-terminal Real in the grammar, and transformed its rules to CNF. The CYK algorithm would then have added Real to the recognition table, wherever that would be appropriate. The rules for Real that would be added to the grammar of Figure 4.15 are:

Real ---> N1 Scale’ | Integer Fraction

The resulting recognition table is presented in Figure 4.17. In this figure, we have also added an extra row at the bottom of the triangle. This extra row represents the non-terminals that derive the empty string. These non-terminals can be considered as possibly occurring between any two adjacent symbols in the sentence, and also in front of or at the end of the sentence. The set Ri,0 represents the non-terminals that can be considered as possibly occurring in front of symbol ti and the set Rn+1,0 represents the ones that can occur at the end of the sentence.

Now we have a recognition table which contains all the information we need to parse a sentence with the original grammar. Again, a derivation starts with the start symbol S. If A1A2 · · ·Am is a right-hand side of S, we want to know if this rule can be applied, that is, if A1A2 · · ·Am derives s1,n. This is checked, starting with A1. There are two cases:

- A1 is a terminal symbol. In this case, it must be the first symbol of s1,n, or this rule is not applicable. Then, we must check if A2 · · ·Am derives s2,n−1, in the same way that we are now checking if A1A2 · · ·Am derives s1,n.

- A1 is a non-terminal. In this case, it must be a member of a R1,k, for some k, or this rule is not applicable. Then, we must check if A2 · · ·Am derives sk+1,n−k, in the same way that we are now checking if A1A2 · · ·Am derives s1,n. If we want all parsings, we must do this for every k for which A1 is a member of R1,k. Notice that non-terminals deriving the empty string pose no problem at all, because they appear as a member of Ri,0 for all i.

We have now determined whether the rule is applicable, and if it is, which parts of the rule derive which substrings. The next step now is to determine how the substrings can be derived. These tasks are similar to the task we started with, and are solved in the same way. This process will terminate at some time, provided the grammar does not contain loops. This is simply an Unger parser which knows in advance which partitions will lead to a successful parse.

Let us go back to the grammar of Figure 4.6 and the recognition table of Figure 4.17, and see how this works for our example input sentence. We now know that Number derives 32.5e+1, and want to know how. We first ask ourselves: can we use the Number--->Integer rule? Integer is a member of R1,1 and R1,2, but there is nothing behind the Integer in the rule to derive the rest of the sentence, so we cannot use this rule. Can we use the Number--->Real rule? Yes we can, because Real is a member of R1,7, and the length of the sentence is 7. So we start our derivation with

Number ---> Real ---> · · ·

Now we get similar questions for the Real non-terminal: can we use the Real ---> Integer Fraction Scale rule? Well, Integer is a member of R1,1, but we cannot find a Fraction in any of the R2,k sets. However, Integer is also a member of R1,2, and Fraction is a member of R3,2. Now, Scale is a member of R5,0; this does not help because it would leave nothing in the rule to derive the rest. Fortunately, Scale is also a member of R5,3, and that matches exactly to the end of the string. So this rule is indeed applicable, and we continue our derivation:

Number ---> Real ---> Integer Fraction Scale ---> · · ·

The sentence is now split up into three parts:

It is left to the reader to verify that we will find only one derivation, and that this is it:
