# 3.4 Recognition and Parsing for Type 0 to Type 4 Grammars

Parsing a sentence according to a grammar is in principle always possible provided we know in advance that the string indeed derives from the grammar. If we cannot think of anything better, we can just run the general production process of Section 2.4.1 on the grammar and sit back and wait until the sentence turns up (and we know it will). This by itself is not exactly enough: we must extend the production process a little, so that each sentential form carries its own partial production tree, which must be updated at the appropriate moments, but it is clear that this can be done with some programming effort.We may have to wait a little while (say a couple of million years) for the sentence to show up, but in the end we will surely obtain the parse tree. All this is of course totally impractical, but it still shows us that at least theoretically any string can be parsed if we know it is parsable, regardless of the grammar type.
