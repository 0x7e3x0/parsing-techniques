# 3.4.3 2型语法

幸运的是，CF（2型）语法有更好的解析算法被人们所熟知，相比0型和1型语法。几乎所有可行的解析都完成了，使用CF和FS语法，并且上下文无关解析遇到的所有问题都已经解决了。这么大差距的原因可以在CF语法的生成过程中发现：Fo rtunately, much better parsing algorithms are known for CF (Type 2) grammars than for Type 0 and Type 1. Almost all practical parsing is done using CF and FS grammars, and almost all problems in context-free parsing have been solved. The cause of this large difference can be found in the locality of the CF production process: the evolution of one non-terminal in the sentential form is totally independent of the evolution of any other non-terminal, and, conversely, during parsing we can combine partial parse trees regardless of their histories. Neither is true in a contextsensitive grammar.

Both the top-down and the bottom-up parsing processes are readily applicable to CF grammars. In the examples below we shall use the simple grammar

### 3.4.3.1 Top-Down CF Parsing

In top-down CF parsing we start with the start symbol and try to produce the input. The keywords here are predict and match. At any time there is a leftmost nonterminal A in the sentential form and the parser tries systematically to predict a fitting alternative for A, as far as compatible with the symbols found in the input at the position where the result of A should start. This leftmost non-terminal is also called the goal of the prediction process.

Consider the example of Figure 3.5, where Object is the leftmost non-terminal, the “goal”. In this situation, the parser will first predict the Noun for Object, but will immediately reject this alternative since it requires the where the input has a. Next, it will try a Noun, which is temporarily accepted. The a is matched and the new leftmost non-terminal is Noun. This parse will succeed when Noun eventually produces dog. The parser will then attempt a third prediction for Object, ProperName; this alternative is not immediately rejected as the parser cannot see that ProperName cannot start with a. It will fail at a later stage.

There are two serious problems with this approach. Although it can, in principle, handle arbitrary CF grammars, it will loop on some grammars if implemented naively. This can be avoided by using some special techniques, which result in general top-down parsers; these are treated in detail in Chapter 6. The second problem is that the algorithm requires exponential time since any of the predictions may turn out wrong and may have to be corrected by trial and error. The above example shows that some efficiency can be gained by preprocessing the grammar: it is advantageous to know in advance what tokens can start ProperName, to avoid predicting an alternative that is doomed in advance. This is true for most non-terminals in the grammar and this kind of information can be easily computed from the grammar and stored in a table for use during parsing. For a reasonable set of grammars, linear time dependency can be achieved, as explained in Chapter 8.

### 3.4.3.2 Bottom-Up CF Parsing

In bottom-up CF parsing we start with the input and try to reduce it to the start symbol. Here the keywords are shift and reduce. When we are in the middle of the process, we have in our hands a sentential form reduced from the input. Somewhere in this sentential form there must be a segment (a substring) that was the result of the last production step that produced this sentential form. This segment corresponds to the right-hand side α of a production rule A→α and must now be reduced to A. The segment and the production rule together are called the handle of the sentential form, a quite fitting expression; see Figure 3.6. (When the production rule is obvious from the way the segment was found, the matching segment alone is often called the “handle”. We will usually follow this custom, but call the matching segment the handle segment when we feel that that is clearer.)

The trick is to find the handle. It must be the right-hand side of a rule, so we start looking for such a right-hand side by shifting symbols from the sentential form into the internal administration. When we find a right-hand side we reduce it to its left-hand side and repeat the process, until only the start symbol is left. We will not always find the correct handle this way; if we err, we will get stuck further on, will have to undo some steps, shift in more symbols and try again. In Figure 3.6 we could have reduced the a Noun to Object, thereby boldly heading for a dead end.

There are essentially the same two problems with this approach as with the topdown technique. It may loop, and will do so on grammars with ε-rules: it will continue to find empty productions all over the place. This can be remedied by touching up the grammar. And it can take exponential time, since the correct identification of the handle may have to be done by trial and error. Again, doing preprocessing on the grammar often helps: it is easy to see from the grammar that Subject can be followed by chased, but Object cannot. So it is unprofitable to reduce a handle to Object if the next symbol is chased.
