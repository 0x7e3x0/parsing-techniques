A right-hand side in a regular grammar contains at most one non-terminal, so there is no difference between leftmost and rightmost derivation. Top-down methods are much more efficient for right-regular grammars; bottom-up methods work better for left-regular grammars. When we take the production tree of Figure 2.15 and if we turn it 45◦ counterclockwise, we get the production chain of Figure 3.7. The sequence of non-terminals rolls on to the right, producing terminal symbols as they go. In parsing, we are given the terminal symbols and are supposed to construct the sequence of non-terminals. The first one is given, the start symbol (hence the preference for top-down). If only one rule for the start symbol starts with the first symbol of the input we are lucky and know which way to go. Very often, however, there are many rules starting with the same symbol and then we are in need of more wisdom. As with Type 2 grammars, we can of course find the correct continuation by trial and error, but far more efficient methods exist that can handle any regular grammar. Since they form the basis of some advanced parsing techniques, they are treated separately, in Chapter 5.
