Finite-choice (FC) grammars do not involve production trees, and membership of a given input string in the language of the FC grammar can be determined by simple look-up. This look-up is generally not considered to be “parsing”, but is still mentioned here for two reasons. First, it can benefit from parsing techniques, and second, it is often required in a parsing environment. Natural languages have some categories of words that have only a very limited number of members; examples are the pronouns, the prepositions and the conjunctions. It is often important to decide quickly if a given word belongs to one of these finite-choice categories or will have to be analysed further. The same applies to reserved words in a programming language.

One approach is to consider the FC grammar as a regular grammar and apply the techniques of Chapter 5. This is often amazingly efficient.

Another often-used approach is to use a hash table. See any book on algorithms, for example Cormen et al. [415], or Goodrich and Tamassia [416].
