# 3.7 Representations of Parse Trees

The purpose of parsing is to obtain one or more parse trees, but many parsing techniques do not tell you in advance if there will be zero, one, several or even infinitely many parse trees, so it is a little difficult to prepare for the incoming answers. There are two things we want to avoid: being under-prepared and miss parse trees, and being over-prepared and pre-allocate an excessive amount of memory. Not much published research has gone into this problem, but the techniques encountered in the literature can be grouped into two models: the producer-consumer model and the data structure model.
