# 3.7.3 Parse Forests

Since a forest is just a collection of trees, the naive form of a parse forest consists
of a single node from which all trees in the parse forest are directly reachable. The
two parse trees from Figure 3.2 then combine into the parse forest from Figure 3.12,
where the numbers in the nodes refer to rule numbers in the grammar of Figure 3.1.

When we look at this drawing, we notice two things: the meaning of the dashed
arrows differs from that of the drawn arrows; and the resulting tree contains a lot of
duplicate subtrees. One also wonders what the label in the empty top node should be.

The meaning of the dashed arrow is “or-or”: the empty top node points to either
the left node marked 2 or to the right node, whereas the drawn arrows mean “andand”:
the left node marked 2 consists of a node marked Sum and a node marked + and
a node marked Sum. More in particular, the empty top node, which should be labeled
Sum points to two applications of rule 2, each of which produces Sum + Sum;
the leftmost Sum points to an application of rule 1, the second Sum points to an application of rule 2, etc. The whole AND-OR tree is presented in Figure 3.13, where
we see an alteration of nodes labeled with non-terminals, the OR-nodes and nodes
labeled with rule numbers, the AND-nodes. An OR-node for a non-terminal A has the
rule numbers of the alternatives for A as children; an AND-node for a rule number
has the components of the right-hand side of the rule as children.
