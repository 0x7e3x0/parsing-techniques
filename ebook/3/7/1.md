# 3.7.1 生产者-消费者模型中的解析输

在生产者-消费者模型中，解析器是生产者，而使用解析树的程序是消费者。正如在计算机科学中的生产者-消费者模型，最直接的问题是，哪个是主进程哪个是子进程。

最好的解决方案是将他们视为同等的，然后可以使用*协同例程（coroutine）*。协同例程在其他的编程语言和编程技术原理中进行了介绍，例如*高级程序语言设计*，作者R.A. Finkel (Addison-Wesley)。在网络上也有很多的解释。

在协同例程模型中，用户对新解析树的需求和解析器对解析树的提供是由协同例程自动配对的。协同例程的问题是，它们必须被内置到编程语言中，并且没有主流的编程语言适应它们。因此，对解析树表示方法协同例程并不是一个实用的解决方案。

协同例程的现代表现方式，线程，其中配对是由操作系统或编程语言内一个轻量级操作系统来完成的，The coroutine’s modern manifestation, the thread, in which the pairing up is done by the operating system or by a light-weight version of it inside the program, is available in some major languages, but introduces the notion of parallelism which is not inherently present in parsing. The UNIX pipe has similar communication properties but is even more alien to the parsing problem.

Usually the parser is the main program and the consumer is the subroutine. Each time the parser has finished constructing a parse tree, it calls the consumer routine with a pointer to the tree as a parameter. The consumer can then decide what to do with this tree: reject it, accept it, store it for future comparison, etc. In this setup the parser can just happily produce trees, but the consumer will probably have to save state data between being called, to be able to choose between parse trees. This is the usual setup in compiler design, where there is only one parse tree and the user state saving is less of a problem.

It is also possible to have the user as the main program, but this places a heavy burden on the parser, which is now forced to keep all state data of its half-finished parsing process when delivering a parse tree. Since data on the stack cannot be saved as state data (except by draconian means) this setup is feasible only with parsing methods that do not use a stack.

With any of these setups the user still has two problems in the general case. First, when the parser produces more than one parse tree the user receives them as separate trees and may have to do considerable comparison to find the differences on which to base further decisions. Second, if the grammar is infinitely ambiguous and the parser produces infinitely many parse trees, the process does not terminate.

So the producer-consumer model is satisfactory for unambiguous grammars, but is problematic for the general case.
