# 3.7.2 Parse Trees in the Data Structure Model

In the data structure model the parser constructs a single data structure which represents all parse trees simultaneously. Surprisingly, this can be done even for infinitely ambiguous grammars; and what is more, it can be done in a space whose size is at most proportional to the third power of the length of the input string. One says that the data structure has cubic space dependency.

There are two such representations: parse forests and parse-forest grammars. Although the two are fundamentally the same, they are very different conceptually and practically, and it is useful to treat them as separate entities.
