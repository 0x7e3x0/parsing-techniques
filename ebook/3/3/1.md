# 3.3.1 构建NDA

NDA直接源于语法。对于一个自顶向下解析，它主要由语法的生成规则组成以及内部控制是最初的起始符号。 The control moves the machine until the internal administration is equal to the input string; then a parsing has been found. For a bottom-up parser the moves consist essentially of the reverse of the production rules of the grammar (see Section 3.2.2) and the internal administration is initially the input string. The control moves the machine until the internal administration is equal to the start symbol; then a parsing has been found. A left-corner parser works like a top-down parser in which a carefully chosen set of production rules has been reversed and which has special moves to undo this reversion when needed.
