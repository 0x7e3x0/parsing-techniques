3.5.6 Non-Canonical Methods

For many practical grammars the above methods still do not yield a linear-time deterministic parser. One course of action that is often taken is to modify the grammar slightly so as to fit it to the chosen method. But this is unfortunate because the resulting parser then yields parse trees that do not correspond to the original grammar, and patching up is needed afterwards. Another alternative is to design a parser so it postpones the decisions it cannot take for lack of information and continue parsing “at half power” until the information becomes available. Such parsers are called non-canonical because they identify the nodes in the parse trees in non-standard, “non-canonical” order. Needless to say this requires treading carefully, and some of the most powerful, clever, and complicated deterministic parsing algorithms come in this category. They are treated in Chapter 10.
