# 3.5 An Overview of Context-Free Parsing Methods

Among the Chomsky grammar types the context-free (Type 2) grammars occupy the most prominent position. This has three reasons: 1. CF parsing results in trees, which allow semantics to be expressed and combined easily; 2. CF languages cover a large part of the languages one would like to process automatically; 3. efficient CF parsing is possible â€“ though sometimes with great difficulty. The context-free grammars are followed immediately by the finite-state grammars in importance. This is because the world and especially equipment is finite; vending machines, remote controls, virus detectors, all exhibit finite-state  ehavior. The rest of the chapters in this book will therefore be mainly concerned with CF parsing, with the exception of Chapter 5 (finite-state grammars) and Chapter 15 (non-Chomsky systems). We shall now give an overview of the context-free parsing methods.

The reader of literature about parsing is confronted with a large number of techniques with often unclear interrelationships. Yet all techniques can be placed in a single framework, according to some simple criteria; they are summarized in Figure 3.11.

We have already seen that a parsing technique is either top-down, reproducing the input string from the start symbol, or bottom-up, reducing the input to the start symbol. The next division is that between directional and non-directional parsing methods.
