# 3.5.7 Generalized Linear Methods

When our attempt to construct a deterministic control mechanism fails and leaves us with a non-deterministic but almost deterministic one, we need not despair yet: we can fall back on breadth-first search to solve the remnants of non-determinism at run-time. The better our original method was, the less non-determinism will be left, the less often breadth-first search will be needed, and the more efficient our parser will be. Such parsers are called “generalized parsers”; generalized parsers have been designed for most of the deterministic methods, both top-down and bottom-up. They are described in Chapter 11. Generalized LR (or GLR) (Tomita [162]) is one of the best general CF parsers available today.

Of course, by reintroducing breadth-first search we are taking chances. The grammar and the input could conspire so that the non-determinism gets hit by each input symbol and our parser will again have exponential time dependency. In practice, however, they never do so and such parsers are very useful.
