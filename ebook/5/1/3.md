Many linear patterns, especially text patterns, have a structure that is easily expressed by a (quasi-)regular grammar. Notations that indicate amounts of money in various currencies, for example, have the structure given by the grammar of Figure 5.5, where has been used to indicate a space symbol. Examples are $ 19.95 and ¥ 1600. Such notations, however, do not occur in isolation but are usually embedded in long stretches of text that themselves do not conform to the grammar of Figure 5.5. To isolate the notations, a recognizer (rather than a parser) is derived from the grammar that will accept arbitrary text and will indicate where sequences of symbols are found that conform to the grammar. Parsing (or another form of analysis) is deferred to a later stage. A technique for constructing such a recognizer is given in Section 5.10.
