### 5.1.1 CF解析中的正则语言

In some parsers for CF grammars, a subparser can be discerned which handles a
regular grammar. Such a subparser is based implicitly or explicitly on the following
surprising phenomenon. Consider the sentential forms in leftmost or rightmost
derivations. Such sentential forms consist of a closed (finished) part, which contains
terminal symbols only and an open (unfinished) part which contains non-terminals
as well. In leftmost derivations the open part starts at the leftmost non-terminal and
extends to the right; in rightmost derivations the open part starts at the rightmost nonterminal
and extends to the left. See Figure 5.1 which uses sample sentential forms
from Section 2.4.3.

It can easily be shown that these open parts of the sentential form, which play an
important role in some CF parsing methods, can be described by a regular grammar,
and that that grammar follows from the CF grammar.
