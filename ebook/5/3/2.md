# 5.3.2 ε-Transitions and Non-Standard Notation

A regular grammar in standard form can only have rules of the form A → a and A → aB. We shall now first extend our notation with two other types of rules, A → B and A → ε, and show how to construct NFAs and DFAs for them. We shall then turn to regular expressions and rules that have regular expressions as right-hand sides (for example, P → a∗bQ) and show how to convert them into rules in the extended notation.

The grammar in Figure 5.14 contains examples of both new types of rules; Figure 5.15 presents the usual trio of NFA, state tree and DFA for this grammar. First con- sider the NFA. When we are in state S we see the expected transition to state B on the token a, resulting in the standard rule S->aB. The non-standard rule S->A indicates that we can get from state S to state A without reading (or producing) a symbol; we then say that we read the zero-length string ε and that we make an ε-transition (or ε-move): S→ε A. The non-standard rule A->ε creates an ε-transition to the accepting state: A→ε ♦. ε-transitions should not be confused with ε-rules: unit rules create ε- transitions to non-accepting states and ε-rules create ε-transitions to accepting states.

Now that we have constructed an NFA with ε-moves, the question arises how we can process the ε-moves to obtain a DFA. To answer this question we use the same reasoning as before; in Figure 5.7, after having seen an a we did not know if we were in state A or state B and we represented that as {A, B}. Here, when we enter state S, even before having processed a single symbol, we already do not know if we are in states S, A or ♦, since the latter two are reachable from S through ε-moves. So the initial state of the DFA is already compound: SA♦. We now have to consider where this state leads to for the symbols a and b. If we are in S then a will bring us to Band if we are inA,awill bring us toA. So the new state includesAandB, and since ♦ is reachable from A through ε-moves, it also includes ♦ and its name is AB♦. Continuing in this vein we can construct the complete state tree (Figure 5.15(b)) and collapse it into a DFA (c). Note that all states of the DFA contain the NFA state ♦, so the input may end in all of them.

The set of NFA states reachable from a given state through ε-moves is called the ε-closure of that state. The ε-closure of, for example, S is {S, A, ♦}.

For a completely different way of obtaining a DFA from a regular grammar that has recently found application in the field of XML validation, see Brzozowski [139].
