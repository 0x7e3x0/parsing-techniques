# 5.4.1 Regular Grammars from Regular Expressions

A regular expression can be converted into a regular grammar by using the trans- formations given in Figure 5.17. The T in the transformations stands for an inter- mediate non-terminal, to be chosen fresh for each application of a transformation; α stands for any regular expression not involving non-terminals, possibly followed by a non-terminal. If α is empty, it should be replaced by ε when it appears alone in a right-hand side.

The expansion from regular expression to regular grammar is useful for obtaining a DFA from a regular expression, as is for example required in lexical analysers like lex. The resulting regular grammar corresponds directly to an NFA, which can be used to produce a DFA as described above. There is another method to create an NFA from the regular expression, which requires, however, some preprocessing on the regular expression; see Thompson [140].

We shall illustrate the method using the expression (ab) (p|q)  . Our method
will also work for regular grammars that contain regular expressions (like A → ab∗cB) and we shall in fact immediately turn our regular expression into such a grammar:

Ss -> (ab)*(p|q)+

Although the table in Figure 5.17 uses T for generated non-terminals, we use A, B, C, . . . in the example since that is less confusing than T1 , T2 , T3 , . . . . The transformations are to be applied until all rules are in (extended) standard form.

The first transformation that applies is P → R∗α, which replaces Ss->(ab)*(p|q)+ by

The first rule is already in the desired form and has been marked ✔. The transforma- tions P → (R)α and P → aα work on A->(ab)A and result in

Now the transformation P → R+ α must be applied to A->(p|q)+ , yielding

The ε originated from the fact that (p|q)+ in A->(p|q)+ is not followed by any- thing (of which ε is a faithful representation). Now A->(p|q)C and C->(p|q)C are easily decomposed into

The complete extended-standard version can be found in Figure 5.18; an NFA and
DFA can now be derived using the methods of Section 5.3.1 (not shown).
