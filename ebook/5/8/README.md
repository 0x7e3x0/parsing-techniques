# 5.8 Top-Down Regular Expression Recognition

The Type 3 recognition technique of Section 5.3 is a bottom-up method collecting hypotheses about the reconstruction of the production process, with a top-down com- ponent making sure that the recognized string derives from the start symbol. In fact, the subset algorithm can be derived quite easily from a specific bottom-up parser, the Earley parser, which we will meet in Section 7.2 (Problem 5.9). Somewhat surpris- ingly, much software featuring regular expressions uses the straightforward back- tracking top-down parser from Section 6.6, adapted to regular expressions. The main advantage is that this method does not require preprocessing of the regular expres- sion; the disadvantage is that it may require much more than linear time. We will first explain the technique briefly (backtracking top-down parsing is more fully discussed in Section 6.6), and then return to the advantages and disadvantages.
